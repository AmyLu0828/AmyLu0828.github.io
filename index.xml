      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first learning experience with a full stack project with AI agents is with this project  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/coleam00/Archon&#34;&gt;https://github.com/coleam00/Archon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is aimed at building an agent with Pydantic AI and Langraph that builds other agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the hands on best project for beginners who just had some encounterance with Agentic workflows, but has only built small-scaled demos and is wondering how these workflows can be turned into actual products/applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of this project to me is that it includes 6 iterations. This gradual process of adding features and optimizations make it easier for me to follow - if you were to throw at me the final version at the very beginning I would not have understand. So, letâ€™s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
